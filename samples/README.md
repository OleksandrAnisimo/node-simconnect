# node-simconnect samples

In order to run the samples you first need to build the node-simconnect project (from the root folder):

```
npm install
npm run build
```

Then (still from the node-simconnect root folder):

-   TypeScript: `npx ts-node .\\samples\\typescript\\<filename>.ts`
-   JavaScript: `node .\\samples\\js\\<filename>.mjs`
